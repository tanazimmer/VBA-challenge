## Week 2 of Data Analytics
### Primary Coding Language: VBA

#### How we did it
Stock data in Excel made available for use.  The goal is to create a script that loops through all stocks (3 sheets) and outputs the following summary table: 
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from opening price at beginning of year to opening price at end of year
  - Total Volume of the Stock
  
Conditional formatting used to highlight yearly change - red for negative change and green for positive change.
